# Appendix C: Historical Timeline of Artificial Intelligence

*From Aristotle to GPT-4*

---

## Pre-History of AI (Before 1950)

### Ancient Origins

**~350 BCE — Aristotle's Syllogistic Logic**
The Greek philosopher develops formal logic—rules for valid reasoning. This is arguably the first algorithm: given premises A and B, conclusion C follows necessarily. Two millennia later, this becomes the foundation of automated reasoning.

**1206 — Al-Jazari's Programmable Automata**
The Islamic polymath creates programmable humanoid automata, including a boat with four mechanical musicians. Pre-modern robotics demonstrate that machines can perform complex, programmed sequences.

**1642 — Pascal's Calculator**
Blaise Pascal, age 19, invents the first mechanical calculator to help his tax-collector father. The Pascaline performs addition and subtraction through interlocking gears. Mechanical computation is born.

**1673 — Leibniz's Stepped Reckoner**
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz extends Pascal's design to multiplication and division. He also dreams of a "calculus ratiocinator"—a universal language for reasoning that machines could process.

**1837 — Babbage's Analytical Engine**
Charles Babbage designs (but never completes) a general-purpose programmable computer. It has memory, a processor, and can be programmed with punched cards. Ada Lovelace writes what many consider the first computer program for it, and speculates about machine intelligence.

**1854 — Boole's Laws of Thought**
George Boole publishes "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought," creating Boolean algebra. Logic becomes mathematical. This will become the foundation of digital circuits.

**1936 — Turing's Universal Machine**
Alan Turing proves that a simple abstract machine (the Turing machine) can compute anything computable. He also proves that some problems are undecidable—no algorithm can solve them. The theoretical foundation of computer science is established.

**1943 — McCulloch-Pitts Neuron**
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity," creating the first mathematical model of a neuron. Neural networks begin.

**1948 — Shannon's Information Theory**
Claude Shannon publishes "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," founding information theory. Concepts like bits, entropy, and channel capacity become rigorous. This will eventually enable understanding of language models.

## The Birth of AI (1950-1956)

### 1950

**June — Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"**
Alan Turing publishes the paper that asks "Can machines think?" He proposes the Imitation Game (now called the Turing Test): if a computer can fool a human interrogator into thinking it's human, it's intelligent. He predicts that by 2000, machines will fool 30% of judges after 5 minutes of conversation.

### 1951

**Marvin Minsky's First Neural Network**
Minsky builds SNARC (Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator), the first neural network computer. It uses 3,000 vacuum tubes and automatic pilot motors from B-24 bombers to simulate 40 neurons.

### 1952

**Samuel's Checkers Program**
Arthur Samuel at IBM creates a checkers program that learns from experience. It's the first self-learning game-playing program and coins the term "machine learning."

### 1955

**"Artificial Intelligence" Proposed**
John McCarthy coins the term "Artificial Intelligence" in a proposal for the Dartmouth Conference:

> "We propose... a 2-month, 10-man study of artificial intelligence... An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves."

### 1956

**Summer — The Dartmouth Conference**
The founding event of AI. McCarthy, Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester organize a workshop at Dartmouth College. Attendees include Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, who present the Logic Theorist—the first AI program, which proves theorems in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica.

The field of Artificial Intelligence officially begins.

## Key Patterns Across History

### 1. Winters Follow Overpromise

Every AI winter followed a period of overpromising. When reality didn't match expectations, funding collapsed. Lesson: Calibrated expectations enable sustainable progress.

### 2. Simple Ideas + Scale = Breakthrough

- Perceptrons: Simple neurons + many units
- Backpropagation: Simple calculus + efficient implementation
- Deep learning: Simple layers + many of them + GPUs
- Transformers: Simple attention + scale
- LLMs: Simple objective + enormous scale

The most powerful AI systems use simple components at massive scale.

### 3. Hardware Enables Software

Every major advance coincides with hardware progress:
- Vacuum tubes → Perceptrons
- Workstations → Expert systems
- GPUs → Deep learning
- TPUs → Large language models

Software ideas often wait decades for hardware to catch up.

### 4. Data Is the Fuel

- ImageNet enabled computer vision
- The web enabled language models
- Human feedback enabled alignment
- Synthetic data may enable what comes next

Without data, algorithms are empty.

### 5. Applications Drive Funding

- Chess and Go captured public imagination
- Voice assistants created consumer markets
- ChatGPT created urgency
- When AI is useful, funding follows.

### 6. Narrow Before General

Every general-purpose advance builds on narrow successes:
- Game-playing → Deep learning
- Image classification → Computer vision
- Machine translation → Language models
- LLMs → General assistants

Solve small problems first, then combine.
