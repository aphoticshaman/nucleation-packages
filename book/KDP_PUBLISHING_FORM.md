## Description (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
What if everything we think we know about AI is incomplete?

A former indie developer noticed something strange: wrong answers from language models clustered together in predictable patterns. That observation led to a theory—and an 84% reduction in inference error.

THE MATHEMATICS OF INTELLIGENCE presents the CIC (Compression-Integration-Coherence) framework: a unified theory connecting information theory, statistical mechanics, and neural computation. The central claim is precise and falsifiable:

Intelligence = Compression = Free Energy Minimization

This isn't philosophy. It's mathematics with working code.

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:

• How transformer attention really works (it's kernel regression)
• Why in-context learning approximates gradient descent
• How phase transitions emerge in LLM inference
• The 50 techniques of the LatticeForge system
• Military doctrine applied to AI safety

WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR:

• ML practitioners who want mathematical foundations
• Researchers exploring unified theories of intelligence
• Engineers building production AI systems
• Anyone curious about what's actually happening inside LLMs

The ideas may be wrong. The code definitely works. This book offers both theory and empirical results—and leaves it to you to decide which survives contact with your own problems.

"Science advances by killing bad ideas. This book is my best current model. Help me make it better." — From the Preface
