## The Pitch

*"The first half teaches you to use AI like a power user. The second half reveals why it works—and introduces a novel mathematical framework (CIC) that achieves 84% error reduction over baseline methods. Then we deploy that framework across 50 innovations for real-world systems. This isn't just a book about AI—it's a research monograph disguised as a practical guide."*
