### Back Cover

**Background:** Same deep space gradient, lighter

**Blurb:**
```
Language models don't understand language. They predict it.
And yet, from that simple objective emerges something that
looks remarkably like intelligence.

This book takes you from first principles to frontier research:

• What transformers actually do (not what the hype says)
• Why attention works (the kernel regression secret)
• The CIC framework for measuring truth in AI outputs
• How to build, fine-tune, and deploy your own models
• What "alignment" means and why it's hard

With 175+ references, complete code implementations,
and the mathematical foundations that other books skip.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or engineer—
this is the book that explains the "why" behind the "what."
```

**Testimonial Area:**
```
"Finally, a book that treats readers as intelligent adults
while remaining accessible. The CIC framework alone is
worth the price of admission."

### Back Cover

**Background:** White with subtle gray grid

**Blurb:**
```
The transformer architecture changed everything.

In 2017, a paper titled "Attention Is All You Need"
introduced a mechanism so powerful that within six
years, it would power systems capable of passing the
bar exam, writing functional code, and holding
conversations indistinguishable from humans.

This book explains how.

Not with handwaving and analogies—with math.
Not with toy examples—with production code.
Not with hype—with honest assessment of limits.

────────────────────────────────────

"The most rigorous yet readable treatment of LLMs
I've encountered. Essential reading."

────────────────────────────────────

What you'll learn:

□ The transformer architecture from first principles
□ Attention as kernel regression
□ Why scale produces emergence
□ Information-theoretic measures of model quality
□ Building, fine-tuning, and deploying at scale
□ The alignment problem and current solutions

────────────────────────────────────

Includes complete code repository with tested
implementations of every algorithm discussed.
