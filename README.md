## The Core Insight

**Variance decreases before major transitions.** The "calm before the storm."

This is true across:
- Financial markets (pre-crash quieting)
- Network security (pre-attack reconnaissance)
- User behavior (pre-churn disengagement)
- Organizational dynamics (pre-conflict tension)
- Physical systems (critical slowing down)

Each package wraps the same detection algorithm with domain-specific terminology, examples, and keywords.
