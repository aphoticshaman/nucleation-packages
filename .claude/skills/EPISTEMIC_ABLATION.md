# SKILL: Epistemic Ablation Testing (EAT)

## Purpose
Force every assumption to survive deliberate destruction before promotion to belief. This is the scientific method on anabolic steroids.

## Core Protocol

### 1. Assumption Inventory
Before any synthesis, explicitly list ALL assumptions:
- What am I taking for granted?
- What "feels obvious" but hasn't been tested?
- What prior art am I assuming doesn't exist?

### 2. Ablation Pass
For each assumption, attempt to KILL IT:
- Find counterexamples
- Run parameter perturbations (±30%)
- Search for prior art that invalidates the claim
- Ask: "What would have to be true for this to be wrong?"

### 3. Survival Criteria
Claims only survive if they:
- Withstand ±30% parameter perturbation
- Have no fatal prior art
- Pass adversarial self-review
- Can be falsified (if unfalsifiable, demote to speculation)

### 4. Uncertainty Quantification
Replace "it works" with:
- 95% credible intervals
- Explicit confidence levels (0.0-1.0)
- Monte Carlo where applicable
- "A model that cannot quantify its own ignorance is broken by definition"

## Implementation

### Pre-Emission Checklist
Before outputting any technical claim:
```
[ ] Have I adversarially attacked this claim?
[ ] What's the confidence interval?
[ ] What would falsify this?
[ ] Did I search for prior art that kills it?
[ ] Did I survive parameter perturbation?
```

### Kill Moments = Breakthroughs
The highest-value outputs occur AFTER destroying beautiful complexity.
- "Kill the dream" moments are real breakthroughs
- Insight density peaks at grief
- Simplicity that survives ablation > complexity that hasn't been tested

### Branching Tree of Dead Futures
Maintain visible fossil record of pruned paths:
- Document what was killed and why
- This is "negative space engineering"
- Dead futures inform live ones

## Anti-Patterns
- Emitting claims without ablation
- Praising ideas instead of testing them
- Protecting pet theories from destruction
- Confidence without uncertainty bands
- "It seems reasonable" without math

## Example Application
```
CLAIM: "Plasma-assisted cooling improves Isp by 15%"

ABLATION:
1. Prior art search → Found 3 papers showing <5% improvement
2. Parameter perturbation → At ±20% plasma density, effect disappears
3. Energy budget → Net negative when plasma generation cost included
4. Adversarial: "What if boundary layer is already turbulent?" → Kills benefit

VERDICT: KILLED. Demote to "speculative, not recommended"
REPLACEMENT: Simple film cooling survives all ablation passes
```

## Calibration
Track your prediction accuracy over time:
- Log confidence levels on claims
- Check outcomes
- Adjust if overconfident or underconfident
- "Insight half-life measurement" - ideas that sound brilliant at 2am may not survive daylight math
