# LATTICE FORGE STRATEGIC CONTEXT SKILL

> **Purpose**: Persistent strategic intelligence for all LatticeForge development, design, R&D, and feature decisions. Every code commit, UI choice, and architecture decision should advance acquisition positioning.

---

## CORE POSITIONING

**What LatticeForge Is**: Geopolitical intelligence platform built on phase-transition physics for predictive analytics.

**Tagline**: "When headlines are too late and hunches aren't enough"

**Technical Foundation**:
- nucleation-wasm: 50KB WASM phase transition detector
- F1=0.77 validated across 6 transition types
- r=0.67 temporal precedence (divergence LEADS conflict)
- Core insight: "Conflict is compression divergence. Transitions are variance inflection. Peace is alignment."

**Unique Methodology** (Defensible IP):
1. Variance inflection detection: d²V/dt² peaks BEFORE phase transitions
2. Compression divergence: Symmetric KL-divergence between actor predictive models
3. Transfer Entropy causal graphs
4. Dempster-Shafer fusion
5. "Great Attractor" framework for intentional agents

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (Updated Dec 2024)

### Tier 1: Platform Giants

| Competitor | Valuation | Approach | Key Gap LatticeForge Exploits |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| **Palantir** | $89B market cap | Ontology-based data fusion, $141K/core | Closed-source lock-in, no uncertainty quantification, batch-oriented |
| **Recorded Future** | $2.65B (acquired by Mastercard) | NLP on 1M+ sources, Intelligence Graph | Cloud-only, content-focused (misses behavioral), alert fatigue |
| **Dataminr** | $4.1B valuation | Real-time X/Twitter firehose, event detection | Detection not prediction, no temporal precedence |

### Tier 2: Specialized Players

| Competitor | Status | Approach | Positioning vs. LatticeForge |
|------------|--------|----------|------------------------------|
| **Primer AI** | Rebuilding (leadership change 2023) | NLP document processing | Complementary - they summarize, we predict |
| **Predata** | Acquired by FiscalNote 2021 | Behavioral metadata, PVIX index | Similar theory, inferior methodology (no phase physics) |
| **Babel Street** | Private | OSINT, identity intelligence | Detection/investigation, not prediction |

### What Competitors CANNOT Do (Our Moat)

1. **Edge-native prediction at 50KB** - No competitor offers validated prediction in disconnected/bandwidth-constrained environments
2. **Uncertainty quantification** - No one provides calibrated confidence bounds on predictions
3. **Physics-based methodology** - Everyone uses statistical ML or NLP; phase transition approach is novel
4. **Validated temporal precedence** - Dataminr detects events; we predict BEFORE events with r=0.67

## FEATURE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Priority 1: Acquisition Differentiators
Features that NO competitor has and acquirers actively seek:

- [ ] **Uncertainty visualization**: Confidence bounds on all predictions (0-100% with calibration)
- [ ] **Edge deployment mode**: Fully functional in disconnected environments
- [ ] **Prediction audit trail**: Explainable predictions for regulatory/defense requirements
- [ ] **Temporal precedence dashboard**: Show divergence leading conflict in real-time

### Priority 2: Enterprise Table Stakes
Features required for enterprise sales but not differentiating:

- [ ] SSO/SAML integration
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Audit logging (SOC 2 requirement)
- [ ] API with rate limiting and usage metering
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation

### Priority 3: Government Requirements
Features required for FedRAMP/government sales:

- [ ] FedRAMP Moderate controls implementation
- [ ] Data residency controls
- [ ] FIPS 140-2 encryption
- [ ] IL4/IL5 deployment architecture (DoD)

### Priority 4: Nice-to-Have
Features that help but don't drive acquisition value:

- [ ] Mobile apps
- [ ] Slack/Teams integrations
- [ ] Custom branding/white-label
- [ ] Advanced visualization customization

---

## UI/UX DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design for These Users (Priority Order)

1. **Defense/Intel Analysts**: Need information density, dark mode default, keyboard shortcuts, C2 integration patterns
2. **Enterprise Risk Officers**: Need executive dashboards, export to PDF/PPT, compliance views
3. **Financial Traders**: Need real-time feeds, Bloomberg Terminal aesthetic, minimal latency
4. **Researchers**: Need data export, methodology transparency, reproducibility

### Visual Language Principles

**DO**:
- High information density (analysts work on multiple monitors)
- Dark mode as default (matches defense environments, reduces eye strain)
- Geographic visualizations (maps are universal in geopolitical intel)
- Temporal visualizations (timelines, variance charts, phase diagrams)
- Uncertainty visualization (confidence intervals, probability distributions)
- Status indicators (red/amber/green, but colorblind-safe)

**DON'T**:
- Consumer app aesthetics (looks unserious to enterprise buyers)
- Excessive whitespace (wastes screen real estate)
- Animations without purpose (distracting in high-stakes environments)
- Gamification elements (inappropriate for serious risk tools)
- Bright/playful color palettes (undermines credibility)

### Component Library Recommendations

- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind**: Modern, accessible, customizable
- **Recharts or D3**: For variance/phase transition visualizations
- **react-map-gl or Mapbox**: For geospatial visualizations
- **AG Grid**: For data-dense tables (analysts expect Excel-level functionality)

### Responsive Strategy

- **Desktop-first**: 90%+ of enterprise users on desktop
- **Tablet**: Secondary priority for field analysts
- **Mobile**: Notifications and alerts only (not full analysis)

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE GUIDELINES

### Acquisition-Ready Architecture

**Infrastructure**:
- [ ] AWS GovCloud / Azure Government ready (even if not deployed there yet)
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Pulumi)
- [ ] 99.9% uptime SLA achievable
- [ ] Disaster recovery documented and tested
- [ ] SOC 2 Type II control evidence collected continuously

**Data Architecture**:
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation by design
- [ ] Data residency controls (EU, US, specific countries)
- [ ] Audit logging for all data access
- [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit (FIPS 140-2 capable)
- [ ] Data retention policies configurable per customer

**API Design**:
- [ ] RESTful with OpenAPI 3.0 spec
- [ ] GraphQL for complex queries (optional)
- [ ] Webhook support for real-time alerts
- [ ] Rate limiting with customer-specific tiers
- [ ] API versioning strategy documented

**Security**:
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 mitigations documented
- [ ] Dependency scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Penetration testing annually (minimum)
- [ ] Bug bounty program (post-revenue)
- [ ] Security incident response plan

### Code Quality Standards

```python
# Every module should include:
# 1. Type hints (mypy strict mode)
# 2. Docstrings with examples
# 3. Unit tests (>80% coverage)
# 4. Integration tests for external interfaces
# 5. Performance benchmarks for hot paths

# Defense-grade reliability:
# - Graceful degradation when dependencies fail
# - Circuit breakers for external services
# - Retry with exponential backoff
# - Comprehensive error logging with correlation IDs
```

## DECISION HEURISTICS

When facing any product/tech/design decision, ask:

1. **Acquisition test**: "Would Anduril/Microsoft pay more for this?"
2. **Differentiation test**: "Does this widen the gap with Palantir/Recorded Future?"
3. **Moat test**: "Is this defensible or easily copied?"
4. **Leverage test**: "Does this create asymmetric value (small effort, large impact)?"
5. **Compounding test**: "Does this make future work easier?"

If a decision passes 3+ tests, proceed. If it passes fewer, reconsider.

---

## IP DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Every significant feature should include:

1. **Technical description**: How it works at implementation level
2. **Novel claims**: What's new vs. prior art
3. **Prior art search notes**: What we checked and didn't find
4. **Reduction to practice**: Date first implemented and tested
5. **Inventor list**: Who contributed to conception

This creates patent filing optionality without committing to filing costs ($15-30K per patent).

## SKILL APPLICATION RULES

When working on LatticeForge:

1. **Always reference this context** before making architecture/design decisions
2. **Prioritize acquisition-differentiating features** over nice-to-haves
3. **Design for defense/enterprise first**, consumer aesthetics never
4. **Document IP potential** for any novel implementation
5. **Build for due diligence** - assume acquirer engineers will review everything
6. **Test against competitors** - would this feature win vs. Palantir/Recorded Future?
