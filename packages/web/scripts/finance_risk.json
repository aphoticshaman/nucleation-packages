Your high risk investment choices have nothing to do with your ability to manage other people's money, unless you fail to make a noteworthy investment return, then your high risk approach will be the death knell to your fund managing aspirations."

    "input": "",
    "output": "The problem above is actually a pretty good list of the concerns around life insurance.  While there is no correct answer to the question as posed, this will vary among different WSCs, there is a simpler way to think about insurance in general that may make finding what is right answer for you easier. Buying life insurance, like almost all insurance, is on average a money losing purchase.  This is simply because the companies selling wouldn't offer it if they couldn't expect to make money on it.  Think about buying insurance (a warranty) on a new cell phone, maybe if you are particularly prone to damaging cell phones it can be in your favor, but for most of the people that buy it will lose money on average. People, of course, still buy insurance anyway to protect themselves from unlikely but very bad consequences.  The big reason to make this trade off is if the loss will have big lasting consequences.  To stay with our cell phone example having to replace a cell phone, at least for me, would be annoying but not a catastrophic event.  For myself, the protection is not worth the warranty cost, but that is not true for everyone. Life insurance is a pretty extreme case of this, but I find the best question to ask is \"if you (you and your spouse) were to die will your dependents lives become so much worse that you really dislike the idea of not being insured?\" For some working seniors, they already have enough saved to bridge their kids/spouse to adulthood/old-age that insurance makes no sense.  For some, their children/husband/wife would be destitute and insurance is an obvious choice and an easy price to pay even if it is very high.  The example you suggest seems on the border and good questions to ask are: Thinking about those questions may help you understand if the protection offers is worth the cost."

The payments are quarterly precisely so you can base them on actual results. Having said that,  I suspect that as long as you show Good Intent they won't quibble if your estimate is off by a few percent. And they'll never complain if you overpay.

But if you want to calculate taxes yourself, and break out the fees you are receiving into several \"buckets\" on the invoice, the company might agree (they might have to run it past their legal department first). I don't see how that helps anything - it just divides the single fee into two pieces with the same overall total. As @mhoran_psprep points out, it appears that the company expects you to cover your expenses from within your charges. Thus, it's up to you to decide the appropriate fees to charge, and you are assuming the risk that you have estimated your expenses incorrectly. If you want the company to pay you a fee, plus reimburse your expenses, you will need to craft that into the contract. It's not clear what kind of expenses you need to be covered, and sometimes companies will not agree to them. For specific tax rule questions applicable to your locale, you should consult your tax adviser."

Venezuela for example restricts citizens to a maximum number of dollars the citizen can buy or sell per year, depending on various factors such as whether or not the person is studying at a foreign university. If the citizen wants to exchange more dollars than legally allowed, that person must buy or sell at the \"black\" market rate, rather than through the official/government market."

For services, it gets tricker. There is a database here that lists what services are taxed in what states; in Wyoming, for example, cellphone services and diaper services are taxed, while insurance services and barber services are not.  For selling over the internet, it gets even dicier. There's a guide on nolo.com that claims to be comprehensive; it states that the default rule of thumb is that if you have a physical presence in a state, such as a warehouse or a retail shop or an office, you must collect tax on sales in that state. Given your situation, you probably only need to collect sales tax on customers in Wyoming. Probably.

Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh.

The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other."

This can be beneficial for businesses when they need to hire someone with a particular skill set. Instead of spending time and resources training a new employee, they can simply hire a VA who already has the expertise they need. \n\n3. Flexible Hours: VAs can often offer flexible hours and be available when their clients need them. This can help businesses save time and money when they need something done quickly. \n\n4. Automation: Many of the tasks a VA can perform can be automated, allowing them to manage multiple tasks at once. This can be beneficial for businesses that have multiple projects on the go and need help keeping up with all the tasks. \n\nFor businesses, a virtual assistant can be an invaluable resource.

This ideal can still be seen in many places today, where those with the skills and knowledge necessary to benefit society are encouraged to become leaders, innovators, and thinkers. In addition, Plato's notion of the \"Forms\" is still applicable today, where things like beauty, courage, and love can exist beyond physical boundaries and be found in people's souls. Finally, Plato's idea of knowledge being a collection of ideas that have been uncovered but never fully understood can be seen in modern times, as we continue to strive to uncover the mysteries of the universe."

The term \u2018aerosol\u2019 refers to tiny particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere, ranging in size from a few nanometers to a few hundred microns. These aerosols can affect the climate in a variety of ways, both directly and indirectly.\n\nAerosols can block, scatter, and absorb solar radiation and thereby reduce the amount of heat reaching the surface. In some cases, aerosols can also act as cloud condensation nuclei and increase cloud brightening, leading to increased cooling of the Earth's surface. Additionally, aerosols can absorb and redistribute solar radiation, leading to regional and global heating effects.\n\nAerosols are also capable of altering the microphysical properties and optical properties of clouds, leading to changes in precipitation and cloud coverage and thus affecting surface reflectivity. Aerosols can also allow for the formation of ice crystals, which can lead to an enhanced ice-albedo feedback and amplified warming. \n\nIn addition to climate effects, aerosols can also affect air quality and human health. Aerosols can reduce visibility, making driving conditions hazardous, and can also reduce air quality by contributing to the formation of smog. These fine particles can also be harmful if inhaled, as they can cause respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.\n\nOverall, aerosols have a complex and far-reaching impact on the climate and human health, and need to be further studied in order to inform policies to reduce air pollution."

But how does the relationship between humans and our furry friends work? Scientists have studied the science behind the interaction between cats and dogs and humans.\n \nThe science of pet therapy has been well researched by scientists. Studies have shown that when pets and humans interact, the people involved exhibit lower levels of stress hormones and an increased \"feel good\" hormone. Studies have also shown that petting a dog can decrease anxiety and help the person become more relaxed.\n\nStudies have found that cats are less socially interactive than dogs, but they have their own way of communicating with humans. In some cases, cats can hear a stranger's voice and knew who it belonged to without having ever met them before. Cats have been found to be social learners that rely on visual cues to interpret their environment.\n\nThe science also includes how cats and dogs adapt to their environment. Dogs are found to be social learners and learn from their environment as well as from humans. They may be able to calm a person with their presence and can be trained to do various tasks. Cats on the other hand are more independent animals and stay close to their surroundings. They can pick up behavioral cues from their environment, more than humans, which is why cats can be so entertaining to watch.",

This buildup can cause an increase in the average global temperature, leading to various impacts such as rising sea levels, melting glaciers, more frequent and intense droughts and heat waves, harsher weather patterns, and increased spread of diseases. Human activities such as burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial emissions are one of the main causes of climate change. The emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases trap heat and energy in the atmosphere, leading to warming temperatures. Deforestation, a process of removing forests to clear land for agricultural activities and other land uses, reduces the amount of carbon dioxide that the trees can absorb, thereby increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Another human activity that contributes to climate change is the production of industrial products and burning of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. To reduce climate change, individuals and businesses can reduce their emissions by making changes such as switching to renewable energy sources, using energy efficient appliances, and adopting sustainable farming practices."

It is determined by the number of air molecules in the atmosphere, and varies depending on the altitude, temperature, and humidity of the environment. As air particles move, they create pressure and pressure gradients, which are areas of increasing and decreasing pressure. Because air is a gas, the particles can easily expand and contract. This is why a tire, for example, can become flat due to a decrease in air pressure. Air pressure is also responsible for the formation of clouds, as the increasing pressure forces heavier droplets of water toward the ground. Thus, air pressure is integral in understanding the phenomenon of our atmosphere."

    "input": "",
    "output": "The primary argument in favor of online education is its increased accessibility and affordability. Online education makes educational opportunities more widely available as it does not require students to be in the same physical location as the instructor, thus allowing them to take classes from anywhere in the world. Additionally, online education is often less expensive than traditional forms of education, as it eliminates many of the costs associated with traditional classroom settings, such as physical textbooks and classroom materials.\n\nThe most commonly cited argument against online education is the potential for decreased student engagement and academic performance. For instance, without an instructor or peers present in the same physical space, it can be difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged in the course material. Additionally, the lack of real-time interaction, such as in-class discussions and real-time feedback, can make it difficult to understand complex concepts and can lead to lower learning outcomes. \n\nOverall, while online education has the potential to be more accessible and affordable, there is also a risk that student engagement and academic performance could potentially suffer. Therefore, it is important to take into consideration both the potential benefits and drawbacks of online education when making decisions about its use."

    "output": "Genetic variability is an important factor in evolution. Genetic variability occurs when individual members of a species differ in the alleles they possess. This variability can arise through mutation, the accumulation of random errors as genes are copied and passed on from one generation to the next. As new alleles are passed on, some of them may confer an advantage to the organism that possesses them. This can cause those beneficial alleles to become more common in subsequent generations, gradually leading to evolutionary change in the species as a whole. The more genetic variability that exists within a species, the more potential there is for these beneficial alleles to arise and for evolution to occur. In this way, genetic variability is one of the driving forces behind evolutionary change."

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

Subsequent to his series of well-publicized experiments, engineers were able to build on his findings and research methods on a course toward developing the world\u2019s first manned aircraft.\n\nBorn in Anklam, Pomerania, Germany, on May 23, 1848, Lilienthal took great interest in the study of birds as a child and as a teenager. In 1870, he graduated from the Royal Technical Academy of Berlin, known today as Berlin University, with a degree in mechanical engineering. Upon graduation, he volunteered for military service during the Franco-Prussian War, which he completed in 1871.\n\nWhile studying in Berlin, Lilienthal began his first experiments with human flight. With his brother Gustav, he built his first wood glider in 1867. This model was unsuccessful, but he continued to build winged vehicles and persevere in his study of the structure of bird wings and the aerodynamics of bird flight.\n\nLilienthal worked in Berlin as an engineer from 1871 to 1883 while he devoted personal time to aviation research. He and his brother became members of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain in 1873, and Lilienthal gave his first public lecture about the theory of bird flight that same year.  He continued to conduct experiments with artificial wings and the way that they responded to the force of air and wind. Meanwhile, he also began inventing and patenting devices in a variety of fields, including a mining machine and children\u2019s building blocks. He would earn some 25 patents over the course of his career, four of which were aviation-related.",

Four genes with potentially pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNV) were detected in three cell lines. SNV were also detected in seventeen HL-related genes and three mitosis-related genes. Copy number variants were detected in four HL-related genes in all five cell lines. Given the high degree of aneuploidy in HL, mitosis-related genes were screened for defects. One mitotic gene (NCAPD2) was amplified in all five HL cell lines, and two genes (FAM190A, PLK4) were amplified in four cell lines. These results suggest that genomic instability of HL may be due to defects in genes involved in chromosome duplication and segregation.",
