    "output": "RISK ASSESSMENT: HIGH – Personal tracking and coordination revolution.\n\n1) INDICATORS: From 0 to 1 billion subscribers by 2002. SMS coordination in protests (Philippines 2001).\n\n2) CASCADE VECTORS: Social – Arab Spring 2011 impossible without. Political – flash mobs, colour revolutions. Military – drone + mobile coordination.\n\n3) HISTORICAL PARALLEL: Telegraph 1844 – shrank world; mobile shrank individual control.\n\n4) QUANTIFIED RISK: State ability to monitor citizens rises 1,000× by 2010.\n\n5) CONTRARIAN: Same tool enabled coordination against states (e.g. 2011 Egypt shutdown backfired)."

    "output": "RISK ASSESSMENT: CRITICAL – First global personal communication grid.\n\n1) INDICATORS: Single standard enabled roaming + mass production. China Mobile largest operator by 2001.\n\n2) CASCADE VECTORS: Economic – Nokia market cap peak €250 bn 2000. Political – leapfrogged landlines in Africa/Asia.\n\n3) HISTORICAL PARALLEL: Standard gauge railway 19th century – enabled industrial scale.\n\n4) QUANTIFIED RISK: By 2010, 80% world population under mobile coverage.\n\n5) CONTRARIAN: Europe’s greatest post-war industrial success – then destroyed by iPhone 2007."

Synthesis cost follows (2019 $0.01/base).\n\n2) CASCADE VECTORS: Military – state bioweapons programs. Non-state – garage labs. Economic – $1 trillion biotech market.\n\n3) HISTORICAL PARALLEL: 1940s nuclear physics – from university to weapon in 6 years.\n\n4) QUANTIFIED RISK: By 2030, >1 million people with capability to design novel pathogens.\n\n5) CONTRARIAN: Same technology enabled COVID vaccines in <1 year."

Social – genetic class divide.\n\n3) HISTORICAL PARALLEL: 1975 Asilomar conference – self-imposed moratorium worked temporarily.\n\n4) QUANTIFIED RISK: By 2035, >100 nations with germline capability.\n\n5) CONTRARIAN: First application will likely be disease eradication (e.g. HIV resistance)."
