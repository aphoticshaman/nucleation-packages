Information-Theoretic Fixed Points in Inference-Time Mathematical Reasoning
A Technical Note on Aggregation, Control, and Verification for AIMO-Style Systems
Abstract

We present a compact information-theoretic framework for inference-time mathematical reasoning, motivated by practical architectures used in AIMO-style competitions. The framework decomposes reasoning into three layers: (i) a rigorous aggregation estimator for modular answers, (ii) a variational control law for adaptive proof search, and (iii) a fixed-point diagnostic for verifier stability. Together, these components formalize how correct mathematical solutions emerge as stable fixed points under noisy generation, bounded computation, and iterative verification.

Remarks.

This is a direct application of circular statistics to the discrete ring

Optimality holds under unimodality or concentration of the true answer cluster.

Uniqueness is not guaranteed for symmetric or bimodal distributions; multiple minimizers indicate ambiguity.

Practical implication.
Toroidal voting and value clustering used in AIMO systems are provably optimal estimators for modular answers, with resultant magnitude

∣R∣/M serving as a confidence measure.

2. Entropic Proof Manifold (EPM): A Variational Control Model

We model proof search as traversal over a discrete graph of partial proofs. Rather than a theorem, EPM is a variational principle that yields an inference-time control law.

Interpretation.
The search stops expanding when additional steps no longer produce sufficient acceleration in conceptual coherence to offset added length and uncertainty.

Practical implication.
This provides an adaptive early-exit and annealing controller for inference-time compute allocation.

3. Ω-Seed Operator: Fixed-Point Diagnostics for Verification

We formalize verification as an iterative refinement loop, not a claim about absolute mathematical truth.

Validity Operator.
Let

V map a candidate proof to a refined proof via causality checks, compression, and integration.

A proof

Boundary discipline.
Divergence indicates insufficiency of the verifier, not Gödelian unprovability.

Practical implication.
Verifier stability becomes a measurable quantity that guides retries, tool use, or termination.

Conclusion

This framework reframes mathematical problem solving as an information-theoretic fixed-point search:

TBT provides a rigorous estimator for aggregating noisy answers.

EPM supplies an adaptive control law for efficient proof search.

Ω-Seed diagnostics quantify verifier stability and convergence.

Together, they explain how correct solutions emerge as stable attractors under stochastic inference, bounded computation, and iterative verification—without overclaiming beyond their operational scope.
