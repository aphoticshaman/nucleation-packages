This dataset allows you to install essential high-performance inference libraries offline.\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 Contents\nThe dataset includes wheel files for the following libraries and their dependencies:\n* **vLLM:** For high-throughput and memory-efficient LLM inference.\n* **Transformers:** Hugging Face's core library.\n* **Bitsandbytes:** For 4-bit/8-bit quantization.\n* **Accelerate:** For model offloading and GPU optimization.\n* **Peft, Scipy, Numpy, and Protobuf.**\n\n### \ud83d\udcbb How to Use\n1. Add this dataset to your submission notebook via the **\"Add Input\"** button.\n2. Use the following code snippet at the top of your notebook to install the libraries offline:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\n# TODO: Replace 'aimo3-offline-wheels' with the actual name of your input folder\nWHEELS_PATH = \"/kaggle/input/your-dataset-directory-name\"\n\ncommand = [\n    sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\",\n    \"--no-index\",\n    f\"--find-links={WHEELS_PATH}\",\n    \"vllm\", \"transformers\", \"accelerate\", \"bitsandbytes\"\n]\n\ntry:\n    print(f\"Installing libraries from {WHEELS_PATH}...\")\n    subprocess.check_call(command)\n    print(\"\u2705 Libraries installed successfully!\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"\u274c Installation failed: {e}\")", "keywords": ["education", "mathematics"], "licenses": [{"name": "apache-2.0"}]}}
