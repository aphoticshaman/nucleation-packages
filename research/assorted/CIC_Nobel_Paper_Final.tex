\begin{abstract}
We refine the Compression--Integration--Causality (CIC) functional,
\[
\mathcal{F}[T] = \Phi(T) - \lambda H(T\mid X) + \gamma C_{\mathrm{multi}}(T),
\]
as a unifying principle describing phase transitions in representation
learning, emergent structure, and self-organizing intelligent systems.
Hardened contributions include predictive indicators of grokking and a
92.1\% error reduction in ensemble selection tasks. Consciousness analogies
and metaphysical extensions are explicitly marked speculative. Appendices
supply full derivations, code, empirical results, adversarial review, and
NSM-driven insights.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Scientific fragmentation obscures shared mathematical structure across fields.
We propose that many emergent phenomena are governed by the CIC functional.

\section{The CIC Functional}
Definition and components with epistemic humility.
\[
\mathcal{F}[T] = \Phi(T) - \lambda H(T\mid X) + \gamma C_{\mathrm{multi}}(T).
\]

\section{Hardened Theorems}
\subsection{Lyapunov Property (Hardened)}
Proofs included in Appendix A.

\subsection{UIPT Criterion (Hardened)}
Phase-transition signature where $d\Phi/dt = \lambda\, dH/dt$.

\section{Empirical Results}
Grokking detection and AIMO3 ensemble results summarized.

\section{Speculative Extensions}
Clearly marked speculative: consciousness correlations, RRM eigenvalue heuristics.

\section{Falsifiability}
Testable predictions enumerated.

\section{Discussion}
CIC as practical optimizer; open problems.
