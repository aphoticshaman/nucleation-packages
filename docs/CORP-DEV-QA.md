# Corp Dev Q&A Kill-Shots

*(Commercial Intelligence Buyers)*

> Short, calm, non-defensive answers that signal experience, inevitability, and asymmetry.
> Each answer is engineered to **end the line of questioning**, not invite debate.

---

## 1. "What if we just build this ourselves?"

### Short Answer

> You can—but you'll spend 12–24 months converging on judgments we've already frozen, and most teams never finish that convergence.

### If They Push

> The hard part isn't the code. It's deciding which indicators matter, where thresholds sit, and which false positives you're willing to tolerate—then shipping those decisions.

**Why This Works:**
* Concede *possibility* (never argue inevitability)
* Shift burden from engineering to **organizational decision-making**
* Frame time as the scarce asset, not talent

---

## 2. "Why can't we just use GPT-4 or another LLM for this?"

### Short Answer

> You can use LLMs for prose. We deliberately don't use them for judgment.

### Follow-Up (Only if Needed)

> In commercial intelligence, repeatability, explainability, and liability matter more than linguistic flexibility. LLMs are excellent at summarization, but they're structurally unsuited for deterministic risk assessment.

### If Someone Says "But GPT-4 is smarter"

> Smarter at language, yes. But intelligence buyers don't want creativity—they want the same conclusion every time from the same inputs.

**Why This Works:**
* Don't attack LLMs
* Downgrade them to a *tool class*, not a competitor
* Align with buyer risk concerns

---

## 3. "What if we combine LLMs with rules?"

### Short Answer

> Hybrid systems tend to inherit the liabilities of both without cleanly owning either.

### If They Push

> The moment an LLM influences judgment, you lose determinism and auditability. At that point, you still need humans to sign off—so you haven't actually reduced risk or cost.

**Why This Works:**
* Sounds like hard-earned experience
* Signals you already tried and rejected hybrids
* Avoids ideological positioning

---

## 4. "What's the bus factor?"

### Short Answer

> The doctrine is explicit, versioned, and replayable. Knowledge isn't trapped in someone's head.

### If They Push

> The system was designed so analysts extend doctrine, not rediscover it. That's the difference between institutional knowledge and founder intuition.

### Optional Add-On

> Post-acquisition, your analysts would own doctrine evolution the same way they own internal risk frameworks today.

**Why This Works:**
* Don't deny founder centrality outright (that sounds fake)
* Show a **path to absorption**
* Lawyers hear "governance," not "hero engineer"

---

## 5. "How do we know your thresholds aren't arbitrary?"

### Short Answer

> They're opinionated, not arbitrary—and that distinction matters.

### If They Push

> Every threshold represents a decision most organizations avoid making explicitly. We've made those decisions, tested them against historical cases, and accepted the trade-offs.

**Why This Works:**
* Reframe "arbitrary" as "explicit judgment"
* Imply courage and discipline
* Subtly indict their internal indecision

---

## 6. "What happens when the world changes?"

### Short Answer

> Then doctrine changes—deliberately, version by version.

### Follow-Up

> We treat geopolitical judgment like policy, not prediction. When assumptions change, they're updated transparently, not implicitly via model drift.

**Why This Works:**
* Neutralizes "models go stale" critique
* Positions determinism as adaptable, not brittle
* Sounds like governance, not engineering

---

## 7. "Aren't rules engines brittle?"

### Short Answer

> Undocumented rules are brittle. Explicit rules are debuggable.

### If They Push

> Probabilistic systems fail silently. Deterministic systems fail loudly—and that's preferable in risk contexts.

**Why This Works:**
* Reverses the usual criticism
* Appeals to risk managers and lawyers
* Sounds like lived experience

---

## 8. "What stops us from rebuilding this after acquisition?"

### Short Answer

> Nothing—and that's exactly why buying it is cheaper.

### If They Look Surprised

> You're buying time, convergence, and a body of decisions you don't have to relitigate internally.

**Why This Works:**
* Radical confidence
* Disarms adversarial posture
* Reframes acquisition as **organizational arbitrage**

---

## 9. "How defensible is this IP, really?"

### Short Answer

> It's defensible in the same way internal risk frameworks are defensible—through ownership, integration, and accumulated judgment.

### Follow-Up

> The value isn't that others can't copy it; it's that they won't, because it's expensive, slow, and uncomfortable to formalize.

**Why This Works:**
* Avoids legal over-claiming
* Aligns with how real IP is defended in practice
* Lawyers stop pushing

---

## 10. "Why hasn't someone else already done this?"

### Short Answer

> Because most organizations prefer probabilistic ambiguity to explicit accountability.

*(Then stop talking.)*

**Why This Works:**
* It's true
* It's slightly confrontational
* Reframes your approach as *counter-cultural*, not naïve

---

## Effect on Valuation

When you answer this way, corp dev thinks:

* "They've seen these questions before"
* "They're not hiding from risk"
* "This asset is already internally converged"

That:
* Reduces perceived integration risk
* Shortens diligence cycles
* Justifies paying for **time saved**, not just code
