# LatticeForge — Pricing & Packaging (Corp Dev–Safe)

> Pricing language engineered to survive S&P Global–class buyers, legal review, and internal resale.

---

## Core Principle

> **All tiers deliver the same analytic conclusions.
> Pricing reflects operational control, integration depth, and governance—not intelligence quality.**

This prevents:
* "Tiered truth" accusations
* Explainability redlines
* Accuracy-based liability traps

---

## Packaging Model Overview

| Level | Purpose | Buyer Mental Model |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Observer | Evaluation | "Can we trust this?" |
| Operational Intelligence | Usage | "Can teams rely on this?" |
| Integrated Intelligence | Embedding | "Can we build on this?" |
| Doctrine Stewardship | Ownership | "Can we govern this?" |

---

## 1. Observer Access (Evaluation Tier)

**Positioning:** *For evaluation, demos, and non-operational review of methodology.*

**Capabilities:**
* Read-only access to cached intelligence snapshots
* Fixed update cadence (e.g., daily global snapshot)
* Full explanations ("why"), limited historical depth
* Methodology and doctrine overview (read-only)
* No APIs, no alerts, no exports

**Talk Track:**
> "This tier exists so teams can validate methodology without operational dependency."

---

## 2. Operational Intelligence

**Positioning:** *For commercial teams consuming intelligence in decision workflows.*

**Capabilities:**
* Rolling updates on defined cadence (hourly / daily)
* Full explanations and confidence context
* Time-series history and trend analysis
* Threshold-based alerts
* Standard REST API access
* Usage-based rate limits

**Explicit Non-Claims:**
* No "better" conclusions than Observer
* No special analytic logic

**Talk Track:**
> "This tier makes intelligence usable day-to-day, without embedding or customization."

---

## 3. Integrated Intelligence

**Positioning:** *For enterprises embedding intelligence into products or internal platforms.*

**Capabilities:**
* On-demand deterministic recomputation
* Batch exports and scheduled jobs
* Webhook support (alerts, state changes)
* Full audit trails (signals, rules, versions)
* Replay guarantees (same inputs + same doctrine = same output)
* Higher throughput and SLAs

**Key Framing:**
> "This tier provides control over *when* intelligence is computed—not *what* it concludes."

---

## 4. Doctrine Stewardship (Strategic / Enterprise)

**This is the tier S&P actually values.**

**Positioning:** *For organizations that treat geopolitical judgment as a governed corporate asset.*

**Capabilities:**
* Access to doctrine registry (read access)
* Visibility into rule sets, versions, and rationales
* Change logs and backward-compatibility guarantees
* Shadow-mode evaluation of proposed doctrine changes
* Contractual governance rights (review cycles, notice periods)
* Optional joint roadmap governance

**What This Is NOT:**
* Not custom analytics
* Not "exclusive intelligence"
* Not consulting

**Talk Track:**
> "This tier governs how judgment evolves, not what judgment says."

---

## Pricing Philosophy

> "Pricing scales with operational surface area, not analytic output."

* Observer: evaluation access
* Operational: usage volume
* Integrated: compute + SLA
* Stewardship: governance + assurance

**Avoid:**
* Per-insight pricing
* Per-country pricing (unless buyers insist)
* "Accuracy-based" claims

---

## What NOT to Put on Public Pricing Page

Do **not** list publicly:
* Doctrine Stewardship details
* Audit guarantees
* Shadow-mode features

Those belong in:
* Enterprise decks
* Corp dev conversations
* Contracts

---

## Internal Buyer Conversation (Target State)

If positioned correctly, S&P's internal conversation becomes:

> "This isn't a feed we resell.
> This is an intelligence substrate we can build on and govern."

That's **tuck-in acquisition language**, not vendor language.

---

## One-Sentence Close

> *"All customers see the same conclusions.
> What changes is how deeply the intelligence is integrated and governed."*

This kills:
* Tiered-truth arguments
* Procurement pushback
* Legal anxiety

---

*Document version: Pricing v1.0*
*Internal use — adapt for specific buyer conversations*
