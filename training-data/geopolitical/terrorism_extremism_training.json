Kinetic/Military**\n\n*Approaches:*\n- Leadership targeting (decapitation)\n- Ground operations (COIN)\n- Air campaigns\n- Special operations raids\n\n*Effectiveness:*\n- Can degrade operational capability\n- Leadership kills disrupt but rarely decisive alone\n- Territorial denial effective against ISIS-type\n- Creates new grievances if civilian casualties high\n\n*Evidence:*\n- Bin Laden kill didn't end Al-Qaeda\n- ISIS territorial defeat effective but ideology persists\n- Drone campaigns controversial on net assessment\n\n**2. Intelligence/Law Enforcement**\n\n*Approaches:*\n- Surveillance and infiltration\n- Financial intelligence (FININT)\n- Information sharing (Five Eyes, Europol)\n- Prosecution and imprisonment\n\n*Effectiveness:*\n- High success rate for plot disruption\n- Works best against networked groups\n- Less effective against lone actors\n- Privacy/civil liberties trade-offs\n\n*Evidence:*\n- Post-9/11 intelligence sharing prevented attacks\n- Most disrupted plots via informants/surveillance\n- Lone actor detection remains poor\n\n**3. Countering Violent Extremism (CVE)**\n\n*Approaches:*\n- Counter-narrative campaigns\n- Deradicalization programs\n- Community engagement\n- Early intervention\n\n*Effectiveness:*\n- Contested evidence base\n- Counter-narratives hard to measure\n- Deradicalization success varies (Saudi vs. others)\n- Community trust essential but fragile\n\n*Evidence:*\n- Some programs show recidivism reduction\n- Government counter-narratives often ineffective\n- Credible voices (former extremists) more impactful\n\n**4. Political Resolution**\n\n*Approaches:*\n- Negotiated settlements\n- Power-sharing arrangements\n- Addressing underlying grievances\n- Amnesty programs\n\n*Effectiveness:*\n- Most effective long-term where applicable\n- Requires group with political aims\n- Doesn't work for apocalyptic ideologies\n\n*Evidence:*\n- Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement\n- Colombia FARC peace process\n- Failed: Spanish-ETA, Russian-Chechen\n\n**5.
