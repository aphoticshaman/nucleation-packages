    "input": "A governing coalition that held 68% of parliamentary seats for 8 years has dropped to 52% following snap elections. Opposition parties are fragmented across 5 different blocs.",
    "output": "Political analysis: The loss of supermajority eliminates unilateral constitutional amendment capability, shifting governance from decisive to negotiated policy-making. Key implications:\n\n1. Legislative gridlock risk: Constitutional changes now require opposition cooperation, likely stalling major reforms\n2. Coalition fragility: Even slight defections threaten majority, increasing leverage of marginal coalition partners\n3. Policy moderation: Expect centrist drift as government courts swing votes\n4. Opposition dynamics: Fragmented 5-bloc opposition prevents unified challenge but complicates grand bargains\n\nMarket-relevant: Watch for policy uncertainty premium in sovereign bonds. Regulatory predictability declines. Investment decisions may pause pending political stabilization. Timeline: 6-12 months for new equilibrium."
