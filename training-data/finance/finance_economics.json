    "input": "",
    "output": "Depends. If you can choose where to relocate to, then I second the \"no income tax\" states. But even of these chose wisely, some have no income taxes at all, others have taxes on some kinds of income. Some don't have neither individual nor corporate taxes, some tax businesses in some ways. Some compensate with higher property taxes, others compensate with higher sales taxes. On the other hand, you might prefer states with income taxes but no sales taxes. It can happen if your current income is going to be low, but you'll be spending your savings. If you don't have a choice (for example, your employer wants you to move closer to their office), then you're more limited. Still, you can use the tax break on moving expenses (read the fine print, there are certain employment requirements), and play with the state taxes (if you're moving to a state with less/no taxes - move earlier, if its the other way - move later). Check out for cities that have income taxes. In some states it cannot happen by law (for example, in California only the state is allowed to collect income taxes), in others it is very common (Ohio comes to mind). Many things to consider in New York. New York City has its own income tax (as well as Yonkers, as far as I remember these are the only ones in the State of New York). So if you want to save on taxes in NYS but live close to the city, consider White Plains etc. If you work in NYC its moot, you're going to pay city taxes anyway. That is also true if you live in NJ but work in the city, so tax-wise it may be more efficient not to live across state lines from your place of work."

From there, after deducting permitted expenses, it flows to 1040 (for income tax) and Schedule SE (for self-employment tax). See https://www.irs.gov/individuals/self-employed for some basics and lots of useful links. If this income is large enough your tax on it will be more than $1000, you may need to make quarterly estimated payments (OR if you also have a 'day job' have that employer increase your withholding) to avoid an underpayment penalty. But if this is the first year you have significant self-employment income (or other taxable but unwithheld income like realized capital gains) and your economic/tax situation is otherwise unchanged -- i.e. you have the same (or more) payroll income with the same (or more) withholding -- then there is a 'safe harbor': if your withholding plus estimated payments this year is too low to pay this year's tax but it is enough to pay last year's tax you escape the penalty. (You still need to pay the tax due, of course, so keep the funds available for that.) At the end of the first year when you prepare your return you will see how the numbers work out and can more easily do a good estimate for the following year(s). A single-member LLC or 'S' corp is usually disregarded for tax purposes, although you can elect otherwise, while a (traditional) 'C' corp is more complicated and AIUI out-of-scope for this Stack; see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/business-structures for more."

Businesses which cater to large numbers of addled tourists sometimes offer one or two alternative currencies in the hopes of charging usurous rates of exchange.

However, if you enter your self-employment income on Schedule C, this spreadsheet will calculate the self-employment tax as well as the income tax.  An advantage is that it is the full 1040, so you can also select the standard deduction and the number of exemptions you are entitled to, enter ordinary W-2 income, even capital gains, etc. Of course you can also make use of other tax software to do this, but in my experience the \"Excel 1040\" is more convenient, as most websites and tax-prep software tend to be structured in a linear fashion and are more cumbersome to update in an ad-hoc way for purposes like tax estimation.

Not everyone has tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash available for a real estate investment. For many Americans, 30-60K needed to buy a property in these markets is an amount they cannot afford to invest, even if they have it at hand. Also, keep in mind that investing in rental property requires being able to support it - pay taxes and expenses even if it is not rented, pay to property managers, utility bills, gardeners and plumbers, insurance and property taxes - all these can amount to quite a lot. So its not just the initial investment. Many times \"advertised\" rents are not the actual rents paid. If he indeed has it rented at $900 - then its good.

When it comes to taxes, you will file a 1040 (the big one, not a 1040EZ nor 1040A).  In addition you will file a schedule C (self-employed income), where you will report the gross paid to you, deduct your expenses, and come up with your profit, which will be taxable.  That profit goes into a line in the 1040.   You need to file schedule SE.  This says how much self-employment tax you will pay on your 1099 income, and it will be more than you expect.  Self employment tax is SS/Medicare.  There's a line for this on the 1040 as well.  You can also deduct half of your self-employment tax on the 1040, there's a line for it.

If you won't have trouble coming up with the $4000 deductible should you need to, then don't get this extra insurance.  * I did not mean to imply that insurance is always a bad idea or that insurance companies are cheating their customers. Please let me explain further.  When you buy any product from a business, that business is making a profit. And there is nothing wrong with that at all. They are providing a service and should be compensated for their efforts.  Insurance companies also provide a service, but unlike other types of businesses, their product is monetary. You pay them money now, and they might pay you money later. If they pay you more money then you spent, you came out ahead, and if you spend more money then they give you, it was a loss for you.  In order for the insurance company to make a profit, they need to bring in more money than they pay out. In fact, they need to bring in a lot more money then they pay out, because in addition to their profit, they have all the overhead of running a business.  As a result, on average, you will come out behind when you purchase insurance. This means that when you are on the fence about whether or not to purchase any insurance product, the default choice should be \"no.\"  On average, you are financially better off without insurance.  Now, that doesn't mean you should never buy insurance. As mentioned by commenter @xiaomy, insurance companies spread risk across all of their customers. If I am in a situation where I have a risk of financial ruin in a certain circumstance, I can eliminate that risk by purchasing insurance. For example, I have term life insurance, because if I were to pass away, it would be financially catastrophic for my family. (I'm hoping that the insurance company makes 100% profit on that deal!) I also continue to buy expensive health insurance because an unexpected medical event would be financially devastating. However, I always decline the extended warranty when I buy a $300 appliance, because I don't have any trouble coming up with another $300 in the unlikely event that it breaks, and I would rather keep the money than contribute to the profits of an insurance company unnecessarily.  In my original answer above, I pointed out how you would determine whether or not to purchase this particular insurance product. This product pays out a bunch of relatively small amounts for certain events, up to a limit of $4000. Would this $4000 be hard for you to come up with if you needed to? If so, get the insurance. But if you are like me and have an emergency fund in place to handle things like this, then you are financially better off declining this policy."

    "output": "In most circumstances prices do not change on a daily basis on most goods and services, and just because inflation is high does not mean all prices of every good and service has to increase over the short term.  Prices are determined by costs of doing business, manufacturing costs and wage growth, and by competition.  For example, if one product has very little competition and costs to produce it have gone up, then the seller might increase prices by 10% to cover their cost of buying the goods off the manufacturer, whilst another product may have plenty of competition, the seller has sourced a new manufacturer from overseas with lower manufacturing costs, they might lower their selling costs by 5% to better compete and increase their sales. Inflation figures are calculated from a set basket of goods and services, and if inflation increases it does not mean that all prices in that basket have gone up, only that the aggregate for the whole basket of goods and services has gone up since the last inflation figures were calculated."

Secondly, it really depends on which country and economy you are talking about. In emerging economies, currencies are very often influenced by the politics of that country. In cases like the US, there are a myriad reasons. The USD is mostly governed by psychology (flight to safety) and asset purchases/sales. In theory, currencies balance, given the inflation of a country and its trade with other countries. e.g. Germany, which was always exporting more than it was importing, had the problem of a rising currency.

From the IRS web site: Self-Employment Income It is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a Form 1099-MISC or if the income is under $600 per payer, the income is not taxable. There is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income. All income earned through the taxpayer\u2019s business, as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self-employment income, which is fully taxable and must be reported on Form 1040. Use Form 1040, Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business, or Form 1040, Schedule C-EZ, Net Profit from Business (Sole Proprietorship) to report income and expenses. Taxpayers will also need to prepare Form 1040 Schedule SE for self-employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $400 for a year. Do not report this income on Form 1040 Line 21 as Other Income. Independent contractors must report all income as taxable, even if it is less than $600.

    "output": "You can deduct what you pay for your own and your family's health insurance regardless of whether it is subsidized by your employer or not, as well  as all other medical and dental expenses for your family, as an itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040, but only to the extent that the  total exceeds 7.5% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) (10% on tax returns for year 2013 onwards). As pointed out in KeithB's comment, you cannot deduct any health insurance premium (or other medical expense) that was paid for out of pre-tax dollars, nor indeed can you deduct any medical expense to the extent that  it was paid for by the insurance company directly to hospital or doctor (or reimbursed to you) for a covered expense; e.g. if the insurance company reimbursed you $72 for a claim for a doctor's visit for which you paid $100 to the doctor, only $28 goes on Schedule A to be added to the amount that you will be comparing to the 7.5% of AGI threshold, and the $72 is not income to you that needs to be reported on Form 1040. Depending on other items on Schedule A, your total itemized deductions might not exceed the standard deduction, in which case you will likely choose to use the standard deduction. In this case, you \"lose\" the deduction for medical expenses as well as all other expenses deductible on Schedule A. Summary of some of the discussions in the comments   Health care insurance premiums cannot be paid for   from HSA accounts (IRS Pub 969, page 8, column 2, near   the bottom) though there are some exceptions.  Nor   can health care insurance premiums be paid from an   FSA account (IRS Pub 969, page 17, column 1, near the top). If you have a business on the side and file a Schedule C as a self-employed person, you can buy medical insurance for that business's employees (and their families too, if you like) as an employment benefit, and pay for it out of the income of the Schedule C business, (thus saving on taxes). But be aware that if you have employees other than yourself in the side business, they would need to be covered by the same policy too.  You can even decide to pay all medical expenses of your employees and their families too (no 7.5% limitation there!) as an employment benefit but again, you cannot discriminate against other employees (if any) of the Schedule C business in this matter.  Of course, all this money that reduced your Schedule C income does not go on Schedule A at all. If your employer permits your family to be covered under its health insurance plan (for a cost, of course), check whether you are allowed to pay for the insurance with pre-tax dollars.  The private (non-Schedule C) insurance would, of course, be paid for with post-tax dollars.  I would doubt that  you would be able to save enough money on taxes to make up the difference between $1330/month and $600/month, but it might also be that the private insurance policy covers a lot less than your employer's policy does.  As a rule of thumb, group insurance through an employer can be expected to offer better coverage than privately purchased insurance. Whether the added coverage is worth the additional cost is a  different matter.  But while considering this matter, keep in mind that privately purchased insurance is not  always guaranteed to be renewable, and a company might decline to renew a policy if there were a large number of claims. A replacement policy might not cover pre-existing conditions for some time (six months? a year?) or maybe even permanently.  So, do consider these aspects as well.  Of course, an employer can also change health insurance plans or drop them entirely as an employment benefit (or you might quit and go work for a different company), but as long as the employer's health plan is in existence, you (and continuing members of your family) cannot be discriminated against and denied coverage under the employer's plan."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Whether you can establish an HSA has nothing to do with your employment status or your retirement plan. It has to do with the type of medical insurance you have.  The insurance company should be able to tell you if your plan is \"HSA compatible\". To be HSA compatible, a plan must have a \"high deductible\" -- in 2014, $1250 for an individual plan or $2500 for a family plan. It must not cover any expenses before the deductible, that is, you cannot have any \"first dollar\" coverage for doctor's visits, prescription drug coverage, etc. (There are some exceptions for services considered \"preventive care\".) There are also limits on the out-of-pocket max. I think that's it, but the insurance company should know if their plans qualify or not. If you have a plan that is HSA compatible, but also have another plan that is not HSA compatible, then you don't qualify. And all that said ... If you are covered under your husband's medical insurance, and your husband already has an HSA, why do you want to open a second one? There's no gain. There is a family limit on contributions to an HSA -- $6,550 in 2014. You don't get double the limit by each opening your own HSA. If you have two HSA's, the combined total of your contributions to both accounts must be within the limit. If you have some administrative reason for wanting to keep separate accounts, yes, you can open your own, and in that case, you and your husband are each allowed to contribute half the limit, or you can agree to some other division.  I suppose you might want to have an account in your own name so that you control it, especially if you and your husband have different ideas about managing finances. (Though how to resolve such problems would be an entirely different question. Personally, I don't think the solution is to get into power struggles over who controls what, but whatever.) Maybe there's some advantage to having assets in your own name if you and your husband were to divorce. (Probably not, though. I think a divorce court pretty much ignores whose name assets are in when dividing up property.)

People may have pensions through systems other than CPP. This is often true for big business or government work. They may work differently. People who retire at 55 with a pension are not getting their pension through CPP. A person retiring at 55 would need to wait at least five years to draw from the CPP, and ten years before he or she was eligible for a full pension through CPP. Canada also offers Old Age Security (OAS). This is only available once you are 65 years old or older, though this is changing. Starting in 2023, this will gradually change to 67 years or older.

Create a pension fund in the corporation, feed it all profits, and pay   out $60k/yr of \"pension\". I doubt that the corporation could deduct a   million a year in pension funding. You cannot do that. You can only deposit to a pension plan up to 100% of your salary, and no more than $50K total (maybe a little more this year, its adjusted to inflation). Buy a million dollars in \"business equipment\" of some sort each year   to get a deduction, then sell it over time to fund a $60k/yr salary. I   doubt such a vehicle exists. If there's no real business purpose, it will be disallowed and you'll be penalized. Your only purpose is tax avoidance, meaning you're trying to shift income using your business to avoid paying taxes - that's illegal. Do crazy Section 79 life insurance schemes to tax-defer the income.   The law caps this so I can only deduct < $100k of the $1 million   annually, and there are other problems with this approach.\\ Yes. Wouldn't go there.  Added: From what I understand, this is a term life insurance plan sponsored by the employer for the employee. This is not a deferral of income, but rather a deduction: instead of paying your term life insurance with your own after tax money, your employer pays with their pre-tax. It has a limit of $50K per employee, and is only available for employees. There are non-discrimination limitations that may affect your ability to use it, but I don't see how it is at all helpful for you. It gives you a deduction, but its money spent, not money in your pocket. End added. Do some tax avoidance like Facebook does with its Double Irish trick,   storing the income in some foreign subsidiary and drawing $60k/yr in   salary to be taxed at $60k/yr rates. This is probably cost-prohibitive   for a $1MM/yr company. You're not Facebook. What works with a billion, will not work with a million. Keep in mind that you're a one-man business, things that huge corporations like Google or Facebook can get away with are a no-no for a sole-proprietor (even if incorporated). Bottom line you'll probably have to pay the taxes. Get a good tax professional to help you identify as much deductions as possible, and if you can plan income ahead - plan it better."

    "output": "The widespread deployment of autonomous robots has the potential to significantly impact our lives in a variety of ways. From a business perspective, it can save time and money by eliminating tedious tasks, freeing up workers to focus on more challenging and rewarding work. From a sociological perspective, it can reduce unemployment rates and lead to the development of new career paths, such as the design and assembly of robots. On a wider scale, autonomous robots can help improve public safety and even reduce traffic congestion due to increased efficiency in transportation and delivery. \n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the potential negative implications of such technology. Autonomous robots could potentially reduce job security in certain industries, and lead to a decrease in wages and working conditions in certain sectors. Additionally, advances in robotics technology may threaten privacy rights, as data collected by robotic systems could be used to track and monitor citizens. Finally, increased automation of labor could lead to mass unemployment, further exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\nOverall, the development of autonomous robots has the potential to greatly improve quality of life, but it is important to consider the potential effects on society before we move ahead with automation."

As the climate warms, the atmosphere also retains more water and produces heavier rains and more flooding, leading to further rises in sea level.\n\nAccording to a study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea levels are projected to rise by 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.2 meters) by the year 2100, with greater rises occurring later in the century. Such a rise would threaten the coastal and island communities, ecosystems, and the infrastructure, such as ports and harbors, that support their economic and social activities.

The Lorenz curve is a graph that plots the cumulative proportion of total income earned by the bottom x% of a population against the cumulative percentage of the population itself. It is calculated by first finding the cumulative percentage of income earned by consecutive segments of the population; these values are then plotted against the cumulative percent of the population and connected. The result is a line that shows cumulative income earned by the bottom x% of the population beneath the 45-degree line of perfect equality. The Gini index is then calculated by taking the area of the triangle beneath the Lorenz curve and above the line of perfect equality, divided by the total area beneath the line of perfect equality. This calculation results in a number between 0 and 1; 0 indicates perfect equality and 1 indicates perfect inequality."

For example, if a country can produce 10 widgets with 20 hours of labor, while another country can only produce 8 widgets with 20 hours of labor, the first country would have an absolute advantage in widget production. This concept of absolute advantage helps countries and companies identify their competitive advantages and understand how best to use their resources in order to stay competitive."

    "output": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades and it is becoming increasingly more important in our society. It is already being used in many industries and applications, from healthcare to self-driving cars, from predictive analyses to military applications. As AI continues to evolve, its implications for our society will become greater and more complex.\n\nOne of the implications of AI is related to employment. As AI becomes more powerful, it will replace certain jobs, such as those which are repetitive and require little human judgement or creativity. This could mean that human workers will be out of a job. In addition, many jobs will be replaced by robots and companies could opt for robotized solutions instead of hiring humans. This could lead to a decline in the number of jobs, leaving many people without jobs.\n\nAI also has ethical implications. Increasingly powerful AI can lead to issues such as privacy, data security, autonomous weapons, and AI bias if it is not used responsibly. There could also be consequences related to the development of autonomous weapons, which can lead to increased destabilization of the world. Furthermore, AI bias is an important issue, since AI systems may not always provide an unbiased perspective on the data they are analyzing.\n\nFinally, AI has the potential to benefit our society in many positive ways. AI can be used to improve efficiency, accuracy and decision making, reduce costs and improve productivity. AI can be used in healthcare to detect earlier signs of diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's, to provide more personalized customer service, assist with research, and aid with various other activities that can improve people's lives.\n\nOverall, AI can have both positive and negative implications for our society. It is important to be aware of the potential risks, and to use AI in a responsible and ethical manner. We need to be prepared to think proactively about the impact of AI so that we can use it to our benefit and not to our detriment."

    "input": "",
    "output": "The implementation of a national minimum wage has both positive and negative economic implications. \n\nOn the positive side, a national minimum wage increases the wages of lower-wage workers and reduces poverty by ensuring that workers are paid an adequate living wage. It also increases worker motivation, encourages recruitment, and reduces workplace stress. Additionally, a higher minimum wage can stimulate economic growth due to increased consumer spending. \n\nOn the negative side, the imposition of a minimum wage reduces the number of available job opportunities due to the resulting increase in labor costs. This can result in fewer people being employed and an increase in underemployment. A higher minimum wage can also be cost prohibitive for small businesses, as they may not be able to afford to hire low-skilled workers. Additionally, a minimum wage increase might lead to price increases for consumers, due to increased production costs for businesses. \n\nIn conclusion, a national minimum wage can help bolster the economy by increasing the wages of workers and encouraging economic growth. There are also potential negative economic implications, however, such as reducing job availability and increasing prices for consumers. Each country should carefully consider the implications and impacts of a national minimum wage before implementing it."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Global warming has been one of the most significant issues in recent times, with its impact being felt across the globe, including the Arctic. Glaciers in the Arctic are melting at an accelerated rate as a result of rising atmospheric temperatures, and this, in turn, is leading to a range of environmental and socio-economic consequences. This report will provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of global warming on the Arctic, based on data from recent studies. \n\nOne of the most visible effects of global warming on the Arctic is the rapid melting of its glaciers. Models based on observed trends and data from the past few decades have indicated that glaciers in the Arctic Ocean could disappear by the end of this century. This would result in a drastic impact on the local environment, including a reduction of sea ice cover and a corresponding rise in sea levels.\n\nThe melting glaciers are also causing changes in the Arctic's climate, as heavier rains and longer summers lead to extended snowmelt and seasonal changes. As a result, local wildlife is facing significant changes in their natural habitats, while native communities are seeing a decline in their hunting grounds. This has serious consequences on the traditional worldview, with some communities now struggling with both social and economic pressures, leading to a surge in migration.\n\nGlacier melting is not the only impact of global warming on the Arctic. The environment of the Arctic is also facing a range of other consequences due to rising temperatures. These include a decrease in permafrost, an increase in the intensity and frequency of wildfires, and a corresponding loss of biodiversity.\n\nIn conclusion, the Arctic is facing a range of consequences as a result of global warming, with the most visible of these being the rapid melting of its glaciers, along with a shift in climate, impacting the environment and native communities. In order to reduce the impact of global warming on the Arctic, it is essential that global governments take urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and implement policies to mitigate the effects of climate change."

Additionally, both wars were caused in part by the system of alliances that existed among nations. \n\nThe consequences of both wars were also similar in that they led to an increase in the power of the influence of the United States and the Soviet Union and an emphasis on the importance of international organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations. Furthermore, both wars led to a greater degree of cooperation between nations in the form of economic and political institutions, international agreements, and mutual defense, and in both cases, the aftermath of the war saw a dramatic increase in human displacement.\n\nHowever, there were distinct differences in the effects of the two wars. World War I saw the end of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, while World War II ended with the division of Germany into East and West. In addition, the advance of totalitarian regimes in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy in the aftermath of World War I gave rise to the political rivalry of the Cold War era, while the end of World War II saw a new era of international cooperation, as well as an effort to create a permanent peace."

    "input": "",
    "output": "The growing gap between the rich and the poor has become an increasingly pressing issue in today's society. Inequality is widespread, with the top 1% of earners taking home nearly a quarter of the nation's income and the bottom 50% of earners only earning 15% of the national income. The disparity is staggering, and the effects of this inequality are devastating for those on the lower half of the ladder. It is time to address this growing inequality and the vast economic disparity that comes with it; the redistribution of wealth is an important step towards a fairer and more equal society.\n\nThe primary benefit of redistributing wealth is that it helps to reduce economic inequality. This is particularly beneficial for lower-income groups, who have little economic access and stability, but would gain more of a say in the economic landscape if income was more evenly distributed. With more equal access to resources, people can invest in their health, education, and development. This can lead to improved productivity in the workforce and a stronger economy. Additionally, the funds from tax revenues that would fund this redistribution of wealth could be used to invest in important social programs and initiatives that can help improve the quality of life for disadvantaged populations.\n\nSimilarly, wealth redistribution can also help to reduce poverty and increase mobility for those in low-income households. This can be done through policies that target the gender income gap, pay inequalities, and support for education and employment opportunities for those in need. In addition, sufficient funds should be given to infrastructure projects and welfare initiatives to reduce the burden on families in low-income households. This can help to create much-needed jobs, as well as provide needed services in communities that would otherwise lack access to financial resources.\n\nWealth redistribution can also bring about a more democratic society. When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, there is a risk of economic and political power becoming consolidated, resulting in the government and businesses becoming distant, more disconnected from the people. Redistribution can work to counteract this concentration of power by bringing economic power closer to the people and allowing them more control over their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, the redistribution of wealth is necessary to create a more just, equitable, and democratic society. It is beneficial to those in low-income households by providing opportunities for economic access and financial stability, as well as helping to reduce poverty and increase mobility. This redistribution can also lead to better public services, increased investment in social programs, and empowered communities."
